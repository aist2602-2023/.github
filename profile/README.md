# Welcome to CUHK AIST2602 2022R2!

This organization is mainly for hosting your course project. You can find these repos here:

* Your "project-milestone2" repo (Milestone 2)
* Your "project-milestone3" team repo (Milestone 3)
* aist2602-2023.github.io (Milestone 3): this repo hosts the GitHub Pages of the organization. In your final task, your team will update the readme page in that repo to add a link to your team's repo.

Under Teams > Everyone > Discussions, you can post messages to chat with all classmates. You can also chat within your own group's Discussions.

Enjoy!
